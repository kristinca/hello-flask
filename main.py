# Flask has two main dependencies.
# The routing, debugging, and Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) subsystems come from Werkzeug,
# while template support is provided by Jinja2.

# There is no native support in Flask for accessing databases, validating web forms, authenticating users,
# or other high-level tasks. These and many other key services most web applications need
# are available through extensions that integrate with the core packages.

# All Flask applications must create an application instance.
# The web server passes all requests it receives from clients to this object for handling,
# using a protocol called Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI).
# The application instance is an object of class Flask,

# Routes and View Functions

# Clients such as web browsers send requests to the web server,
# which sends them to the Flask application instance.
# The application instance needs to know what code needs to run for each URL requested,
# so it keeps a mapping of URLs to Python functions.

# The association between a URL and the function that handles it is called a ROUTE.
# The most convenient way to define a route in a Flask application is
# through the app.route decorator exposed by the application instance,
# which registers the decorated function as a route.
